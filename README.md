# 👋 Hi, I’m Karim Zouine



Hi there! I’m Karim — a **Solution Architect** based in **Stuttgart, Germany**, who enjoys building tools, learning new things, and contributing to the open-source community.

I work mainly with cloud and backend technologies, helping teams design scalable systems and improve how software gets built and deployed.

One of my side projects, [**imgcompress**](https://hub.docker.com/r/karimz1/imgcompress), has grown to around **[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/karimz1/imgcompress)](https://hub.docker.com/r/karimz1/imgcompress) uses**, which I’m really grateful for it’s amazing to see something small I made helping others.





## **🛠️** **What I Work With Every Day**

### **💻** **.NET Development**

- Building practical, maintainable applications for real-world needs.
- Writing clean, reliable code and improving team development standards.
- Working with **SQL databases** to ensure strong, ACID-compliant operations in production systems.




### **☁️** **AWS & Azure DevOps**

- Designing and automating **cloud architectures** that balance scalability and simplicity.
- Setting up **CI/CD pipelines** and deployment workflows to make development smoother.
- Using **Azure Cloud** where needed — not an expert yet, but always learning and improving.




### **🐳** **Docker**

- Containerizing applications for consistent environments across development and production.
- Simplifying deployments and supporting reproducible builds.




## **🌱** **What I’m Learning & Exploring**

I like staying curious and experimenting with tools that make software development simpler and more enjoyable.

Some of the technologies I’ve been spending time with lately include:

- 🐍 **Python** – scripting, automation, and small side tools.
- 🗄️ **SQL** – optimizing queries and managing relational data.
- ⚙️ **.NET** – my main stack for building stable, modern applications.
- ☁️ **AWS** – deepening my understanding of cloud architecture.
- 🚀 **Azure DevOps** – improving delivery pipelines and team collaboration.
- 🌩️ **Azure Cloud (a little)** – learning more as I go.
